# Keyboard Notches

This mod makes it so that the Remote Controller provides one "notch" of input on the respective control.

The DeadZone of the Remote Controller joysticks can also be changed. Default is 0.2, the new default is 0.8.

Pressing and holding any of the key joysticks for more than 400ms reverts to default behavior so you can still quickly ramp-up and own your throttle and independent brake for example.
